## Results Report ##

In the final variant calling file (sample.vep.vcf), annotated with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), 
in total 40 variants have been detected - 38 SNVs (95%) and 2 short DELs (5%). 
The most frequent variant types are missense variants (62.5%), followed by synonymous variants (25%). 
Among the SNVs, three are genotyped as heterozygous (GT: 0/1) and the rest (35 variants) are homozygous SNVs (GT: 1/1).
The detected heterozygous SNVs are found to have low to moderate impact in transcripts of coding sequences, 
and modifier impact in non-coding regions.
