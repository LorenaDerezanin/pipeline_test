## Results Report ##

In the final variant calling file (sample.vep.vcf), annotated with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), 
in total 40 variants have been detected - 38 SNVs (95%) and 2 short DELs (5%). 
The most frequent variant types in coding sequence are missense variants (64.6%), followed by synonymous variants (31.3%), 
implying strong selective pressure.
Among the SNVs, three are genotyped as heterozygous (GT: 0/1) and the rest (35 variants) are homozygous nonreference SNVs (GT: 1/1),
which leads to heterozygosity ratio of 0.0857 (het. sites / nonref. hom. sites).
The detected heterozygous SNVs are found to have low to moderate impact in transcripts of coding sequences, 
and modifier impact in non-coding regions.

Based on the low heterozygosity ratio, we can conclude that the sample of this particluar coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV Tor2), 
having more nonref. homozygous sites, originates from population genetically farther from the reference genome. 
These are possible causes:
- strong positive selection leading to fixation of beneficial alleles through selective sweep, 
sample has twice as many nonsynonymous variants compared to synonymous
- high mutation rate and potential past recombination events might have led to this divergence and expansion of host ranges, 
as these coronaviruses are associated with different hosts, reference genome is isolated from a bat, 
and the sample in question, from a human host.
